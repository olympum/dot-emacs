dot-emacs
=========

My Emacs configuration files. Requires Emacs 24. Key things I need
that it provides:

* Javascript
* Scala
* Clojure
* Markdown

## Go (Golang)

I have added some Go support, but I am not actively using Go. To get
go running, godef and golang are required. I have set my GOPATH in the
init file, I am sure there are better ways.
